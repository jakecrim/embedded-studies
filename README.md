# Embedded Studies

Each folder is a functional IAR project, containing a main.c (and other source files) focusing on some fundamental low-level programming areas that I found important to know for embedded systems development. The main.c is the first file that should be looked at to get an understanding of what concept is being focused on.

## Folders

* **rawRegisterLEDBlinkTI**: Specific name for a specific lesson, here we directly write to the addresses for a GPIO base, GPIO direction, GPIO data enable, and GPIO data. By writing the correct values to these registers, we can get a specific GPIO block on, and blink an LED.

* **introToHAL**: Basics of using the Texas Instruments provided hardware access header file definitions for addressing and accessing specific GPIO registers, volatile keyword, bit-wise operators, etc.

* **More**: Will continue to add project folders as I visit and revisit specific embedded system/low-level concepts.
